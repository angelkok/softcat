Softball Team Catalog Rails App

-Every team has a name and a list of players.
-Every player has a name and a position and belongs to a single team.
-A user can perform standard CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for teams and players.
-For each team, the user can see a list of its players.
-The user can see a list of all teams with the number of unique positions present in each team. (For example: If the Oregon City Giants team has a pitcher named Alex, a pitcher named Lee, and a shortstop named Mel, then its number of positions is 2.)
